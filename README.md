# DancesafeResults

Web application to be hosted locally while Dancesafe Chapters are on site in order to better record reagent results.

## About
This project is for the better collection of reagent testing results and a whole lot more for Dancesafe chapters across the world. 

As of right now I'm envisioning this having 2 large portions of it, firstly is this part, a localized version that will eventually live on a raspberry pi 3. 

The end result should be an image that'll be easily burnable to a 16GB MicroSD card and plugged directly into a raspberry pi and be good to go. Granted, I'm a long away from that.... 

## Requirements

Right now the python requirements should be listed in the setup.py, but outside of that you'll need access to a postgresql server running wherever. Currently I have mine running locally. 

## TODO
- [ ] populate TODO list with actual TODO items
